Movie Picture Pipeline â€” a full-stack project I built with a Flask backend and React frontend, both containerized with Docker and deployed on AWS EKS using GitHub Actions CI/CD. It includes automated testing, ECR image builds, and Kubernetes deployment with LoadBalancer services. The app displays movie info through a clean, responsive UI. Everything from setup to deployment is fully automated and production-ready.
